# CodeSignalAlgoPractice
## To improve my algorithm solving skills I am documenting my work as I progress through the problems in CodeSignal. Each problem will have a ReadMe where I may explain my thinking and steps to solving the problem. The best way to learn something is to try to teach it, and so this repo is my effort to emulate this process.
