# CodeSignalAlgoPractice
### To improve my algorithm solving skills I am documenting my work as I progress through the problems in CodeSignal. Each problem will have a ReadMe where I may explain my thinking and steps to solving the problem.(Edit: it became to cumbersome to create a ReadMe for each problem and so I opted to no longer doing thtat) The best way to learn something is to try to teach it, and so this repo is my effort to emulate this process.
